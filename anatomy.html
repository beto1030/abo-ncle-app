    <h3>Cornea</h3></br>
    <p>The cornea is the transparent, dome-shaped surface that covers the front of the eye.</p>
</div>
<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3>Retina</h3></br>
    <p>The retina is a layer of tissue in the back of the eye that senses light and sends images to your brain.</p>

<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Iris </h3></br>
    <p> The colored part of the eye </p>
</div>
<!--
- Divides the front and back of the eye.
- Its color comes from pigment cells called melanin
- The color, texture, and patterns of each person's iris are as unique as a fingerprint.
- Controls the amount of light that enters the eye, does this by constriction and dilation of the pupil.
- Controls the amount of light that enters the eye just like aperture of a camera
- The sphincter muscle that lies around the edge of the pupil contracts in bright light, causing the pupil to constrict.
- The dilator muscles run radially through the iris, like spokes on a wheel, this muscle dilates the eye in dim lighting and allows more light in
-->

<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Pupil </h3></br>
    <p> Is the black circle at the center of the iris. </p>
</div>
<!-- 
-its actually a round opening that is controlled by the iris.
- The pupil averages 3.5 millimeters in size when the eye is in normal illumination. However can range from as little as 1.3mm to 10mm. In general as we mature, the pupil tends to get smaller.
- During the course of the day, the size of the pupil changes hundreds of times as it responds to different stimuli. The size of the pupil will change in response to oscillation or movement of the eyes. 
- When fitting bifocal contact lenses it is important to know that convergence, or the eyes coming together such as when someone is reading, will sightly constrict the pupils. The response to light stimuli is perhaps the most common reason pupil sizes will change. 
- In order to control the amount of light entering the eye, the pupil will constrict in bright light, and dilate to allow more light in dim illumination. 
- Drugs and medications will also change the size of the pupil; some will constrict while others dilate.

    <h3> Sclera </h3></br>
    <p> The white part of the eye </p>
</div>
<!--
- Its a dense, tough tissue that protects the inner structures of the eye.
- Made from the same tissue as the cornea, but its opaque meaning it does not let light pass through
- The sclera makes 5/6 of the eye's shell. The remaining 1/6 is the cornea, the transparent portion of the eye
-->

<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Conjunctiva </h3></br>
    <p> The soft, thin, transparent loose mucus membrane that covers the sclera as well as the inside of the lids.  </p>
</div>
<!--
- Bulbar conjunctiva is the portion of the conjunctiva that's visible.
    - bulbar conjunctiva = covers sclera
- Palpebral conjunctiva is the portion of the conjunctiva that is not visible.
    - palpebral conjunctiva = covers eyelids
- Fornix is the area where bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva meet
-->

<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Limbus </h3></br>
    <p> This is the transition zone were the cornea and sclera meet.  </p>
</div>
<!--
- Blood vessels are prominent at the limbus and with ocular irritations such as allergies, infections, and in the presence of foreign bodies like contact lenses, these vessels may dilate. This is called limbal engorgement.
- The blood vessels in the conjunctiva can also dilate and when this happens it is called conjunctival injection or simply injection.
    - when there is long term corneal edema, these blood vessels can actually invade the cornea. This is called neovascularization.
        - Since the cornea needs to be clear for optimal vision, this situation is obviously best avoided.

<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Outermost Layer </h3></br>
    <p> Together the cornea, sclera, conjunctiva and limbus form the eye's outermost layer </p>
</div>


<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Anterior Chamber </h3></br>
    <p> This is a fluid filled space between the cornea and iris.  </p>
</div>
<!--
- Located right behind the cornea, in front of the iris
- Filled with a thin, watery fluid called the aqueous humor. This fluid provides nourishment to the cornea and the crystalline lens of the eye and helps to give the front of the eye its form and shape.
- Approximately every 90 mins, the aqueous humor is completely replenished.
    - If something interferes with the drainage of the old aqueous humor from the eye, the fluid will begin to build up, increasing the pressure inside the eye
        - Over time, this pressure can cause damage to the optic nerve and is known as glaucoma

<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Crystalline Lens </h3></br>
    <p> A flexible, transparent structure that is located in the posterior chamber behind the iris and in front of the vitreous body.  </p>
</div>
<!--
- Just like the cornea, the crystalline lens is transparent with no blood supply of its own
- Its biconvex and it role is to focus light rays onto the retina
- Responsible for 1/3 of the eye's total refractive power which is approximately +15.00 to +16.00D of power. The Cornea is responsible for the remaining 2/3.
- As the crystalline lens becomes denser with age, cloudy opacities form known as cataracts.
    - A patient with cataracts will not notice pain but may complain of hazy vision, a film over the eyes, or an increased sensitivity to glare.
        - By age of 75 to 85, nearly everyone will have cataracts to some degree.
        - While cataracts occur because of the aging process, some infants can be born with cataracts. These are known as congenital cataracts.
        - Cataracts can also occur as a result of injury, trauma, or disease and are called traumatic cataracts.

<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Ciliary Muscles </h3></br>
    <p> These muscles control the shape of the crystalline lens.  </p>
</div>
<!--
- The ciliary body is the structure in the eye that produces the transparent aqueous humor that fills the anterior and posterior chambers.
    - There are 2 sets of ciliary muscles attached above and below the crystalline lens by connective tissues called zonular fibers. The muscles are responsible for shaping the lens to focus light on the retina
    - When the ciliary body contracts, the zonules relax. This allows the crystalline lens to thicken, increasing the eye's ability to focus up close.
    - When the ciliary body relaxes, the zonules contract. This allows the crystalline lens to become thinner, adjusting the eye's focus for distance vision.
        - This ability of the eye to change focus is called accommodation.
- In young people, the crystalline lens easily changes shape to adjust for either near or distance vision.
    - With age, however the lens gradually hardens and muscles that hold the crystalline lens in place become weaker, making the ability to accommodate and change focus more difficult.
        - We call this presbyopia.
-->

<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Vitreous humor </h3></br>
    <p> is a gel like substance that fills the eye between the crystalline lens and retina.  </p>
</div>
<!--
- The vitreous is firmly attached to areas of the retina yet as it thins, it separates from the retina, and can cause floaters
- In children, the vitreous has a consistency similar to egg white, but with age it gradually thins and becomes more liquid.
-->

<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Choroid </h3></br>
    <p> A layer of tissue in the eye that sits between the sclera and retina.  </p>
</div>
<!--
A lining that is sandwiched between the retina and the sclera. This layer contains a lot of blood vessels and is responsible for nourishing the back of the eye with oxygen.
- The choroid connects with the ciliary body toward the front of the eye, and is attached to the edges of the optic nerve at the back of the eye.
-->

<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Retina </h3></br>
    <p> A light sensitive tissue at the back of the eye.  </p>
</div>
<!--
- a multi-layered sensory tissue that lines the back of the eye. It contains millions of photoreceptors that capture light rays 
    - and converts them into electrical impulses.
    - these impulses travel along the optic nerve to the brain where they are turned into images.
    - The 2 different types of photoreceptors or nerve cells found in the retina are called rods and cones.
        - There are 125 million rods that are primarily responsible for night vision and are scattered throughout the retina.
        - There are 6 to 7 million cones that are responsible for the sensation of color, and are used when there is light.
            - Most of the cones are found in the fovea, which is the part of the retina that sees the clearest.
- where is the blind spot located on the retina?
    - Because there are no rods or cones in the optic nerve, it creates a normal blind spot in everyone.
        - Most people never notice their blind spot because the vision of both eyes overlaps.
- At the center of the retina is the macula.
    - It contains a high concentration of photoreceptor cells that convert light into nerve signals and allow us to see fine details.
    - At the center is a tiny dimple called the fovea centralis.
        - this area contains only cones, and is responsible for the sharpest, most brilliantly colored vision.

<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Retinal Detachment </h3></br>
    <p> This is when the retina detaches from the choroid, the tissue responsible for providing nourishment to it.  </p>
</div>
<!--
-If the retina pulls away from the choroid, that portion of the retina can atrophy or die and unless there is immediate medical intervention, vision can be lost forever
-This is considered an ocular emergency
-->

<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Macular Degeneration </h3></br>
    <p> An ocular condition that affects a small area located at the center of the retina that's responsible for sharp detailed vision call the macula.  </p>
</div>
<!--
- Together the macula and fovea are responsible for clear, sharp vision, and provide the central part of vision.
    - If there is a degeneration in the macula, patients may notice that their vision is not as clear as it should be
        - vision may be distorted, colors may be more difficult to distinguish and there may even be areas straight ahead where vision is simply lost.
-->

<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Optic disc </h3></br>
    <p> A circular area located at the back of the eye where the optic nerve exits the retina.  </p>
</div>
<!--
- This is the blind spot of the eye where there are no photoreceptors
-->

<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Optic Nerve </h3></br>
    <p> The optical nerve is a bundle of nerve fibers that carries visual information from the retina to the brain.  </p>
</div>
<!--
    - It connects to the back of the eye near the macula.
- Because there are no rods or cones in the optic nerve, it creates a normal blind spot in everyone.
    - Most people never notice their blind spot because the vision of both eyes overlaps.
- Ensuring healthy development of the optic nerves is one of the most important reasons for infants and young children to have eye exams.
    - If good signals aren't sent along both optic nerve pathways during their development
        - That means the optic nerve could potentially atrophy or die and vision will forever be lost.
