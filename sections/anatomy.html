    <h3>Eyelids</h3>
    <p>The eyelids protect your eyes, keep them moist, and control how much light gets in. They’re your eyes’ first defense against harm and everyday irritants, helping to keep them healthy and working well. Your eyelids protect your eyes by acting like a shield. When something like dust or dirt comes close, your reflexes make you blink to block it. They also help spread tears across your eye every time you blink, which washes away tiny particles and keeps your eyes moist. If there’s bright light or wind, your eyelids can squint or close completely to stop irritation or damage. At night, they stay closed to protect your eyes from drying out and anything that might accidentally touch them.</p>
</div>

<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3>Fibrous Tunic</h3>
    <p>The fibrous tunic, the eye's outer layer, includes the sclera and cornea. The sclera maintains shape and protects the eye, while the clear cornea lets in and focuses light for vision.</p>
</div>

<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3>Sclera</h3>
    <p>The sclera is the white, tough outer layer of the eye that protects its inner structures, maintains shape, and anchors eye muscles for movement.</p>
</div>

<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3>Extraocular Muscles</h3>
    <p>There are 6 extraocular muscles controlling eye movement: the superior rectus moves the eye up, the inferior rectus moves it down, the medial rectus pulls it inward, and the lateral rectus moves it outward. The superior oblique and inferior oblique rotate the eye for precise positioning. Together, they ensure smooth, coordinated movements.</p>
</div>

<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3>Cornea</h3>
    <p>The cornea is the clear, front part of the eye that helps focus light and shields it from dirt and damage.</p>
</div>

<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3>Tear Film</h3>
    <p>The tear film, often called the pre-corneal layers, have three layers that keep your eyes healthy and moist. The lipid layer, made by glands in your eyelids, prevents tears from evaporating. The aqueous layer, produced by lacrimal glands, hydrates the eye and provides nutrients. The mucin layer, created by cells in the conjunctiva, helps tears stick evenly to the eye's surface. Together, these layers protect your eyes, keep them smooth, and reduce the risk of dryness or irritation.</p>
</div>

<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3>Corneal Layers</h3>
    <p>The cornea has five layers that work together to protect the eye and maintain vision. The epithelium absorbs oxygen and nutrients, while the Bowman’s layer adds strength and shields the cornea. The stroma, the thickest layer, provides structure and clarity, supported by the Descemet’s membrane, which acts as a barrier against infections. The innermost endothelium keeps the cornea clear by removing excess fluid, ensuring transparency and proper focus.</p>
</div>


<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3>Vascular Tunic</h3>
    <p>The vascular tunic, or uvea, is the middle layer of the eye responsible for providing blood supply, nutrients, and support for vision. It includes the iris, which controls the amount of light entering the eye by adjusting the pupil size; the ciliary body, which produces aqueous humor and adjusts the lens for focusing; and the choroid, which nourishes the retina and other eye structures. These components work together to maintain the eye’s health, regulate pressure, and help focus light onto the retina.</p>
</div>

<!--<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3>Cornea</h3></br>
    <p>The cornea is the transparent, dome-shaped surface that covers the front of the eye.</p>
</div>-->
<!--
Since the cornea is transparent, it has no blood supply of its own.
Instead, the tears provide the important nutrients and oxygen that the blood normally supplies to other parts of the body.

The total power of the eye is approximately 60 Diopters
    The cornea provies 2/3 of the total refractive capability
    The crystalline lens provides the remaining 1/3

Unless we look very closely, we cannot see the cornea with our naked eye.
    However this transparent part of the eye approximately coincides in size with the visible iris
        AND has an average horizontal diameter of 11.7mm and a average vertical diameter of 10.6mm.

    Note: The cornea is approx 1.25mm larger than the iris

    <h3> Macula </h3></br>
    <p> This is a small, specialized area near the center of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed central vision.  </p>
</div>-->
<!--
Contains a high concentration of cone photoreceptor cells, which detect color and fine details, making it essential for tasks like reading, driving, and recognizing faces.
The center of the macula, known as the fovea, is the point of greatest visual acuity, where cones are most densely packed AND there are no rods, enhancing its ability to capture fine detail

<!--
Average blink rate is 7 to 12 times per minute
With every blink the lids spread tears over the corneal surface.
    This creates a smooth, wet surface that keepsthe corneal metabolism performing at optimum levels.

<!--<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Iris </h3></br>
    <p> The colored part of the eye </p>
</div>-->
<!--
- Divides the front and back of the eye.
- Its color comes from pigment cells called melanin
- The color, texture, and patterns of each person's iris are as unique as a fingerprint.
- Controls the amount of light that enters the eye, does this by constriction and dilation of the pupil.
- Controls the amount of light that enters the eye just like aperture of a camera
- The sphincter muscle that lies around the edge of the pupil contracts in bright light, causing the pupil to constrict.
- The dilator muscles run radially through the iris, like spokes on a wheel, this muscle dilates the eye in dim lighting and allows more light in
-->

<!--<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Pupil </h3></br>
    <p> Is the black circle at the center of the iris. </p>
</div>-->

<!-- 
-its actually a round opening that is controlled by the iris.
- The pupil averages 3.5 millimeters in size when the eye is in normal illumination. However can range from as little as 1.3mm to 10mm. In general as we mature, the pupil tends to get smaller.
- During the course of the day, the size of the pupil changes hundreds of times as it responds to different stimuli. The size of the pupil will change in response to oscillation or movement of the eyes. 
- When fitting bifocal contact lenses it is important to know that convergence, or the eyes coming together such as when someone is reading, will sightly constrict the pupils. The response to light stimuli is perhaps the most common reason pupil sizes will change. 
- In order to control the amount of light entering the eye, the pupil will constrict in bright light, and dilate to allow more light in dim illumination. 
- Drugs and medications will also change the size of the pupil; some will constrict while others dilate.
-->

<!--<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Sclera </h3></br>
    <p> The white part of the eye </p>
</div>-->
<!--
- Its a dense, tough tissue that protects the inner structures of the eye.
- Made from the same tissue as the cornea, but its opaque meaning it does not let light pass through
- The sclera makes 5/6 of the eye's shell. The remaining 1/6 is the cornea, the transparent portion of the eye
-->

<!--<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Conjunctiva </h3></br>
    <p> The soft, thin, transparent loose mucus membrane that covers the sclera as well as the inside of the lids.  </p>
</div>-->
<!--
- Bulbar conjunctiva is the portion of the conjunctiva that's visible.
    - bulbar conjunctiva = covers sclera
- Palpebral conjunctiva is the portion of the conjunctiva that is not visible.
    - palpebral conjunctiva = covers eyelids
- Fornix is the area where bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva meet
-->

<!--<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Limbus </h3></br>
    <p> This is the transition zone were the cornea and sclera meet.  </p>
</div>-->
<!--
- Blood vessels are prominent at the limbus and with ocular irritations such as allergies, infections, and in the presence of foreign bodies like contact lenses, these vessels may dilate. This is called limbal engorgement.
- The blood vessels in the conjunctiva can also dilate and when this happens it is called conjunctival injection or simply injection.
    - when there is long term corneal edema, these blood vessels can actually invade the cornea. This is called neovascularization.
        - Since the cornea needs to be clear for optimal vision, this situation is obviously best avoided.

- Located right behind the cornea, in front of the iris
- Filled with a thin, watery fluid called the aqueous humor. This fluid provides nourishment to the cornea and the crystalline lens of the eye and helps to give the front of the eye its form and shape.
- Approximately every 90 mins, the aqueous humor is completely replenished.
    - If something interferes with the drainage of the old aqueous humor from the eye, the fluid will begin to build up, increasing the pressure inside the eye
        - Over time, this pressure can cause damage to the optic nerve and is known as glaucoma

    <h3> Crystalline Lens </h3></br>
    <p> A flexible, transparent structure that is located in the posterior chamber behind the iris and in front of the vitreous body.  </p>
</div>-->
<!--
- Just like the cornea, the crystalline lens is transparent with no blood supply of its own
    - The crystalline lens doesnt get nutrients the same way as the cornea; it gets its nutrients from the aquious humor, the clear fluid that fills the space between the cornea and the lens - known as the anterior chamber.
        The aqueous humor supplies the crystalline lens with oxygen, glucose, and other essential nutrients and helps remove metabolic waste
- Its biconvex and it role is to focus light rays onto the retina
- Responsible for 1/3 of the eye's total refractive power which is approximately +15.00 to +16.00D of power. The Cornea is responsible for the remaining 2/3.
- As the crystalline lens becomes denser with age, cloudy opacities form known as cataracts.
    - A patient with cataracts will not notice pain but may complain of hazy vision, a film over the eyes, or an increased sensitivity to glare.
        - By age of 75 to 85, nearly everyone will have cataracts to some degree.
        - While cataracts occur because of the aging process, some infants can be born with cataracts. These are known as congenital cataracts.
        - Cataracts can also occur as a result of injury, trauma, or disease and are called traumatic cataracts.
- When a patient has had a cateract removed, this means they had there crystalline lens removed

</div>-->

<!--<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Ciliary Muscles </h3></br>
    <p> These muscles control the shape of the crystalline lens.  </p>
</div>-->

<!--
- The ciliary body is the structure in the eye that produces the transparent aqueous humor that fills the anterior and posterior chambers.
    - There are 2 sets of ciliary muscles attached above and below the crystalline lens by connective tissues called zonular fibers. The muscles are responsible for shaping the lens to focus light on the retina
    - When the ciliary body contracts, the zonules relax. This allows the crystalline lens to thicken, increasing the eye's ability to focus up close.
    - When the ciliary body relaxes, the zonules contract. This allows the crystalline lens to become thinner, adjusting the eye's focus for distance vision.
        - This ability of the eye to change focus is called accommodation.
- In young people, the crystalline lens easily changes shape to adjust for either near or distance vision.
    - With age, however the lens gradually hardens and muscles that hold the crystalline lens in place become weaker, making the ability to accommodate and change focus more difficult.
        - We call this presbyopia.

<!--<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Aqueous Humor </h3></br>
    <p> Fluid that fills the anterior chamber and posterior chamber of the eye located between the cornea and the crystalline lens.  </p>
</div>-->
<!--
Functions of the Aqueous humor
    * Nourishment
        the aqueous humor provides nutrients and oxygen to the avascular (lack of blood vessels) structures in the eye such as the cornea and crystalline lens
    * Maintains intraocular pressure (IOP)
        the aqueous humor helps maintain the eye's intraocular pressure, which is the pressure inside the eye. This is crucial for keeping the eye's shape and for optimal functioning of the eye's optical components
    * Waste Removal
        the aqueous humor helps remove metabolic waste products from the cornea and lens, which don't have blood vessels to flush out waste on their own.
    * Regulation of Fluid Balance
        the fluid produced by the ciliary body (a part of the eye located behind the iris), flows through the posterior chamber, and moves into the anterior chamber via the pupil.
            From there it drains out of the eye through the trabecular meshwork and into schlemm's canal.
            This drainage system helps regulate the fluid balance within the eye and maintains normal intraocular pressure


Production and Flow
    * Production: the aqueous humor is produced by the ciliary body, specifically by the ciliary processes.
        It is secreted into the posterior chamber and flows through the pupil into the anterior chamber.
    * Circulation: After circulating through the chamber, the aqueous humor drains out of the eye via the trabecular meshwork, which directs it into the Schlemm's canal.

        The fluid then enters the bloodstream, ensuring that the eye's fluid levels remain balanced (HOW???)

    <h3> Trabecular meshwork </h3></br>
    <p> The trabecular meshwork is a specialized, spongy tissue structure located within the iridocorneal angle. It is responsible for filtering and draining the aqueous humor (the fluid that fills the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye) out of the eye.  </p>
</div>-->

<!--<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Schlemm's canal </h3></br>
    <p> A circular channel that runs around the entire circumference of the eye at the trabecular meshwork area, which is found in the limbus. This is where the aqueous humor produced by the ciliary muscles drains out of the eye </p>
</div>-->

<!--<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Vitreous Humor </h3></br>
    <p>Is a clear, gel-like substance that fills the large space in the back of the eye between the crystalline lens and retina.</p>
</div>-->
<!--
Functions of the vitreous humor
    * maintains the shape of the eye
        helps maintain the eye's spherical shape by exerting pressure on the retina and other structures within the eye.
        this pressure helps keep the retina in place preventing it from detaching

    * supports the retina
        helps keep the retina pressed against the back of the eye, ensuring that the retina remains in its optimal position to capture light and send visual signals to the brain. It acts as a cushion, providing a stable environment for the retina.

    * light transmission
        the vitreous humor is transparent, allowing light to pass from the crystalline lens to the retina.

    * storage of metabolites
        the vitreous humor also serves as a storage area for various nutrients and metabolites that help maintain the health of the eye.
        It DOES NOT circulate as much as the aqueous humor, but it helps keep the retina and lens nourished

    * lack of blood supply
        The vitreous humor does not have blood vessels, this is why it remains clear and transparent. allowing unobstructive light to reach the retina.

Structure of the vitreous humor
    * gel-like consistency: made up of mostly water (about 98-99%) and a small amount of collagen and hyaluronic acid, which give it its gel-like consistency
    
    * location: it fills the vitreous chamber, which is the large cavity behind the crystalline lens and in front of the retina

    * changes with age: as a person ages, the vitreous humor may begin to shrink and become more liquid.
        This can lead to a condition called vitreous detachment, where the vitreous humor separates from the retina.
            While often harmless, this condition can sometimes cause issues like floaters or, in rare cases, retinal tears

- The vitreous is firmly attached to areas of the retina yet as it thins, it separates from the retina, and can cause floaters
- In children, the vitreous has a consistency similar to egg white, but with age it gradually thins and becomes more liquid.

    <h3> Choroid </h3></br>
    <p> A layer of tissue in the eye that sits between the sclera and retina.  </p>
</div>-->
<!--
A lining that is sandwiched between the retina and the sclera. This layer contains a lot of blood vessels and is responsible for nourishing the back of the eye with oxygen.
- The choroid connects with the ciliary body toward the front of the eye, and is attached to the edges of the optic nerve at the back of the eye.
-->

<!--<div class="carousel-slide">
    <h3> Retina </h3></br>
    <p> A light sensitive tissue at the back of the eye.  </p>
</div>-->
<!--
- a multi-layered sensory tissue that lines the back of the eye. It contains millions of photoreceptors that capture light rays 
    - and converts them into electrical impulses.
    - these impulses travel along the optic nerve to the brain where they are turned into images.
    - The 2 different types of photoreceptors or nerve cells found in the retina are called rods and cones.
        - There are 125 million rods that are primarily responsible for night vision and are scattered throughout the retina.
        - There are 6 to 7 million cones that are responsible for the sensation of color, and are used when there is light.
            - Most of the cones are found in the fovea, which is the part of the retina that sees the clearest.
- where is the blind spot located on the retina?
    - Because there are no rods or cones in the optic nerve, it creates a normal blind spot in everyone.
        - Most people never notice their blind spot because the vision of both eyes overlaps.
- At the center of the retina is the macula.
    - It contains a high concentration of photoreceptor cells that convert light into nerve signals and allow us to see fine details.
    - At the center is a tiny dimple called the fovea centralis.
        - this area contains only cones, and is responsible for the sharpest, most brilliantly colored vision.

    <h3> Macular Degeneration </h3></br>
    <p>An eye condition that leads to the deterioration of the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision</p>

<!--
- Together the macula and fovea are responsible for clear, sharp vision, and provide the central part of vision.
    - If there is a degeneration in the macula, patients may notice that their vision is not as clear as it should be
        - vision may be distorted, colors may be more difficult to distinguish and there may even be areas straight ahead where vision is simply lost.

- macular degeneration, also known as age-related macular degeneration (AMD)
    Primaryly affects older adults and is one of the leading causes of vision loss in people over 50.
        Affects central vision, making tasks like reading, driving, recognizing faces, and other detail-oriented activities increasingly difficult
    There are 2 types of AMD
        Dry AMD: The more common type, where small yellow deposits called drusen accumulate under the retina, gradually thinning and damaging the macula. Vision loss is typically slower and progresses over years
        Wet AMD: A less common but more severe form, where abnormal blood vessels grow under the retina and leak fluid or blood, leading to rapid damage of the macula. This type progresses more quickly and can lead to significant vision loss in a shorter time.

    while there is no cure for AMD, lifestyle changes, nutritional support, and in cases of wet AMD there are treatments like anti-VEGF injections that can help slow progression and preserve vision longer.
